A simple feature match isn't enough, because we don't want to copy the objects from the style painting, just its texture and feel. Gram matrices are the solution. They are a mathematical tool that describes an image's style by ignoring object placement and instead capturing which visual patterns (like colors and brushstrokes) tend to appear together.
